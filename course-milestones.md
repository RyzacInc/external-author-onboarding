## Review Process
The goal of the review process is to ensure that the team is aligned and the vision for the content has been achieved. During the review process, the reviewer goes over the deliverable to ensure that the deliverable meets our content and quality standards. Once the review is complete, the reviewer may approve or deny the deliverable.

If the deliverable is approved, you may move on to the next step. If the deliverable is denied, the reviewer will provide feedback using Jira and you must revise your work. You will then resubmit your revised work and await the second round of review. 

>__Note__ There should be no more than three rounds of feedback. If the deliverable needs more than that the Curriculum Programs team will intervene and determine next steps.

## Pre-Launch Retrospective
After the deliverables have been completed successfully and on-time, the team will have a _retro_ or a pre-launch retrospective meeting. This meeting is to review how the production process went for all parties and to prepare for the potential launch of your work.

After this meeting is over, the Curriculum team will manage the course and determine the best launch strategy.
