# Using the Jira Board

## Overview
The Codecademy Curriculum team uses the agile workflow features in Jira with custom configurations and fields to manage production projects. The goal for your Jira boards is to use Jira as a single source of truth across your team for your project as it automates changes and centralizes information. In this document, we will break down the agile features of the Jira.
## Introduction
Jira Software Cloud is a project management tool that allows you to plan, track, and launch projects Jira also has reporting features that allow project managers to view and take action to improve the team's performance in real-time.

Jira allows you to customize the tool to reflect your team's workflow. Jira integrates with other tools that we use at Codecademy frequently like:
- DropBox
- GitHub
- Gmail
- Google Calendar
- Google Drive
- Invision
- Slack
- Zapier
- Zendesk
- And other tools.

## Features
### Projects
Projects in Jira are a cumulative group of workflows for a specific team or group. Projects can be broken down into components, or sub-groups of smaller aspects of the larger project. Projects are made of a series of tasks, known as issues, that will be explained further in this document. Check out the key terminology for the project feature below.

| Feature | Description |
|----|----|
| Versions  | Different adaptations of the same project can be tracked and have issues assigned to them. |
| Workflow  | The sequence of steps that the tasks will follow (i.e.`In Progress`,`Resolved`). The project should follow processes that mirror the team's practices.  |
|  Screen |  Arrange the fields to filter and display specific views of the project. |
| Repositories  | Add a GitHub repository to show information about branches, commits, and pull requests required for a project inside a Jira issue.  |

### Team Members
#### Project Administrator
The project administrator, in most cases, is the team project manager. The project administrator maintains the project versions, components, and user roles.  They also maintain project boards and start/end project sprints, which we will discuss further in this document.
#### Roles in Jira
Jira enables the project administrator to assign particular users to specific roles (i.e. `Author` or `Reviewer`). Roles define user capabilities and settings like frequency of Jira notifications. The project administrator can set up Jira notifications the appropriate roles when particular events take place in a project (i.e. when an issue is moved or a comment is made). You can choose specific people, groups, or roles to receive notifications.

Roles oftentimes have different permissions associated with them. Permissions allow the project administrator to control who can access the project, and what they can do. Access to individual issues is granted to users by issue permissions.

## Jira Boards
Boards are a view of the project's workflow in the most current, or live, state of the project. Based on the workflow and anticipated outcome of the project, you must choose a Jira board style: scrum, kanban, or hybrid. We will be managing course production with a **kanban board**. Kanban boards manage work by visually displaying work and/or project tasks at various stages of the project or process. 

## Issues
Issues are the deliverable tickets that move through the kanban board as the project progresses. Each issue has an epic tag that's used to associate the issue to its course. For example, an issue may have the epic tag of `Introduction to HTML` because that is the course the issue is associated with. If you are stuck or need help with something, you should move the issue to the `Blocked` column. Issues also have fields like Google Drive attachments, link inputs, and deadlines that are used by the team to keep the project organized.
