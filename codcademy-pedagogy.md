# Terminology

While writing, it's important that you're familiar with common pedagogical terminology in the Codecademy teaching framework. You will be presented with the following terms:

| Term  | Definition  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Outcomes | Outcomes are the high-level takeaways from a course or module. An individual learning outcome should be learner-focused and encapsulate the body of knowledge covered by the content. |
| Learning Standards | Learning standards focus on the goals for understanding and learning. They include objective statements about desired understanding, knowledge, and/or skills for the learner. |
| Objectives | An objective is a learner-focused goal of any introduction to new material. We generally begin objectives with the phrase "learners will be able to" or LWBAT. Objectives serve as a guide for the content author while they introduce new material. The content and practice in the course or module should build towards achieving the goal set by the learning objective. |
